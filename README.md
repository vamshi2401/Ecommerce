**BUSINESS INSIGHTS from EDA** 

**Regional across regions Insights**
Regional differences in revenue contribution are significant; in 2024, South America accounted for the largest share at $219,352.56, followed by Europe at $166,254.63. North America ($152,313.40) and Asia ($152,074.97) produce comparable amounts of revenue, but they fall far short of South America and Europe. From 2023 to 2024, all regions saw a significant increase in growth year over year.
With zero revenue to average revenue for the subsequent year, South America has a rising client base and efficient monetization. Perhaps it is a result of local tastes or focused advertising. Despite having similar numbers of customers, Asia and North America generate lower revenues, suggesting a chance for cross-selling or more effective product targeting.
**Customer insights**
Compared to Europe (50), North America (46), and Asia (45), South America has the largest consumer base (59). The number of new clients has been steadily increasing, reaching a peak of 79 in 2024. South America leads the world in both the number of customers and the region's revenue contribution. Successful customer acquisition tactics are reflected in the consistent increase in signups. Given its dominance, South America is a desirable location for growing marketing campaigns and client retention initiatives due to its high market demand. The substantial surge in 2024 might be the result of product releases, marketing, or economic recovery.

**Product price per category**
The category with the highest average and median prices is Books ($292.21), followed by Electronics ($275.35) and Clothes ($263.72). While all categories have a wide variety of prices, home décor products are the least expensive on average ($235.02), with clothing having the largest price variation (std. dev. $157.96). 

Higher average prices for books and electronics indicate that consumers are willing to pay more, whether as a result of demand or perceived quality. The large variety of clothing prices could be a sign of a mix of high-end and low-cost products, appealing to a wider market. The modest pricing of home décor point to the possibility of upselling more expensive items.
**Annual Revenue**
Revenue grew from $3,769.52 in 2023 to $686,226.04 in 2024, showcasing exponential growth. This increase is likely driven by a combination of higher transaction volumes, increased average spending, and product diversification.
The substantial rise in revenue highlights business scalability and effective market penetration. A detailed analysis of 2024 trends can reveal which strategies or product categories contributed most. Sustaining this growth requires maintaining customer engagement, introducing innovative products, and focusing on high-performing regions and categories.
**Top products**
     In 2023, ActiveWear products, such as Jackets ($1,585.36), Smartphones ($958.80), and Smartwatches ($911.44), were top sellers. In 2024, customer preferences shifted towards TechPro Headphones ($19,513.80), ActiveWear Rugs ($17,946.91), and TechPro Cookbooks ($17,905.20).
     ActiveWear products dominated sales in 2023, reflecting a focus on fitness and lifestyle trends. In 2024, the rise of TechPro products suggests a shift toward electronics and lifestyle categories. Analyzing this transition can help identify changing customer priorities and inform future product development and marketing strategies.
